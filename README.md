# Microservices setup

This is a project based on the following Udemy course that I wanted to replicate: _Event-Driven Microservices: Spring Boot, Kafka and Elastic_.
Thus, it basically replicates the same structure followed in this course by I have adapted it to my personal tastes.

## Boot up

In order to make all this work, it is only needed to go to the `docker` folder and execute the following
command:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

> If any more information is needed, you can check the specific docker [README](docker/README.md)
